<p>As a contributor to the field of consciousness science and its literature, I have found myself increasingly frustrated by the lack of a proper medium to publish short commentaries and corrections in reply to recent articles. 

Often, what needs to be said doesn't warrant the time and effort of submitting an article-length reply to an official journal, but also exceeds what can efficiently be transmitted by a tweet. Personal communication, in my experience, has been the most effective and collegial way to address this issue so far.

Recently, however, public debates about <strong>the nature of consciousness and the theories attempting to address it</strong> have become more frequent, dynamic, and heated. 
In particular the <a href = "http://integratedinformationtheory.org/" >Integrated Information Theory (IIT)</a> of consciousness gets a lot of flak in these discussions, as it is unique in its approach&mdash;
starting from the essential properties of phenomenology itself&mdash;
and it actually comes with a detailed mathematical formalism.
As a long-term contributor to IIT and its formal framework, it is my impression that often clarifications of minor (and major) misunderstandings could go a long way to keep the discussion constructive and productive. 
<!-- Certain issues regarding IIT and its take on consciousness tend to come up again and again, which made me wish for a place to make 
 replies on record to refer to. -->

<p>
This blog is my attempt to contribute to the ongoing conversation about consciousness and its theories by providing  <strong>a platform for constructive criticism and debate</strong>, as well as a repository of clarifications regarding IIT and its take on consciousness in particular.

<strong>Disclaimer:</strong> These are my starting points: Consciousness is subjective experience, or phenomenology (terms will be used equivalently) &mdash;
not a function performed by the brain. Consciousness is real &mdash; doubting its existence doesn't make sense.
